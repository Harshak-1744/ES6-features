# ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) Features

ES6, also known as ECMAScript 2015, introduced several new features and improvements to JavaScript. Below are some of the notable features:

## Arrow Functions
A concise syntax for writing functions, using the "=>" symbol. This simplifies function expressions and ensures lexical scoping.

## Classes
ES6 introduced class syntax, providing a more familiar and structured way to create objects and define their behavior, similar to other object-oriented programming languages.

## Template Literals
Template literals allow for easier string interpolation and multiline strings, using backticks (`) instead of single or double quotes.

## Destructuring Assignment
A convenient way to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables, making it easier to work with complex data structures.

## Enhanced Object Literals
ES6 introduced shorthand syntax for defining object properties and methods, making object creation and manipulation more concise.

## Modules
A standardized way to organize and share JavaScript code across multiple files, allowing for better code separation and reusability.

## Promises
A built-in mechanism for handling asynchronous operations, providing a more structured and readable way to write asynchronous code compared to callbacks.

## Default Parameters
The ability to define default values for function parameters, ensuring that functions can be called with fewer arguments without causing errors.

## Spread Operator
A concise syntax for expanding arrays or objects into individual elements, making it easier to combine, clone, or manipulate complex data structures.

## Iterators and Generators
ES6 introduced the concept of iterable objects and generators, enabling more powerful and flexible control flow and iteration over data.
